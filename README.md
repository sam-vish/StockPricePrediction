# StockPricePrediction
A deep learning model for predicting stock prices based on historical data. Using LSTM neural networks to analyze patterns and make future price predictions.

# Stock Price Prediction using Deep Learning

This project utilizes deep learning techniques to predict stock prices based on historical data. It employs a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture called Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to capture temporal dependencies and make accurate predictions.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a model that can predict future stock prices based on past price and volume data. The LSTM model is trained on historical stock data and learns patterns and trends to forecast future price movements.

## Key Features

- Utilizes LSTM, a powerful recurrent neural network architecture for sequential data analysis.
- Preprocesses the historical stock data to create a suitable input format for the LSTM model.
- Scales the data using Min-Max scaling to ensure numerical stability during training.
- Implements a sliding window technique to generate input sequences and corresponding output labels.
- Trains the LSTM model using historical stock data and evaluates its performance.
- Uses the trained model to predict future stock prices and visualize the predictions.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-price-prediction.git
2. Install the require dependencies
  ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
  
 ## USAGE
1. Prepare the data:

- Download historical stock data in CSV format and place it in the data directory.
- Run the data preprocessing script to preprocess the data:
```python data_preprocessing.py```

2. Train the LSTM model:

- Adjust the hyperparameters and network architecture in the train.py file if needed.
- Run the training script to train the model:

3. Evaluate the model:

Run the evaluation script to assess the model's performance on the test data:
shell

```python evaluate.py```

4. Make predictions:

Adjust the prediction parameters in the predict.py file if desired.
Run the prediction script to generate future stock price predictions:
shell

```python predict.py```
